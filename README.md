Installation Instructions

There are two easy installation options for this application depending on how you would like to use it. 

1. Clone the repository into a local directory, and click on the index.html file.

2. Clone the repository into a server that looks for index.html such as apache2 or node.

If you decide to modify any of the stylesheets you will need to run the sass compiler included in the repository in the tools folder. If you are running Windows simply navigate to the tools folder and double click on sass-dev.bat. If you are installing this system on a unix based system navigate to the tools folder in shell enter sudo sh sass-dev.sh

These tools will automatically watch all of the individual sass files and compile the css for you.
